The World that is the setting on which the campaign exists is actually a moon. One of seven moons that orbit a gas giant planet. The gas planet has a series of rings around it similar to a multi-ring gyroscope. 
The seven moons are the protective ward that keeps the gas planet's inhabitants on planet and from infecting the universe. i.e. the Pliedes
The fact that the world is a moon means that the gravitational pull from the planet causes a signifcantly higher amount of tidal change on the oceans. 
This causes ship travel near land to be highly dangerous depending on the tides and it causes port cities to be significantly higher in elevation so that they don't get flooded and washed away. 
It also has led to the need and use of aerial travel rather than naval.
